Things of note now:
  Chrome Extensions CANNOT run in-line javascript.
  All JS (besides src="js" lines) must be exterior (see ext/app/scripts).
  To run the extension, after pulling the new commit, go the chrome://extensions, check developer mode, click load unpacked extension, select the app directory.

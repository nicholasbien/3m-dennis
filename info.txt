Current Issues:

Long load time on first play after refresh. (Possible fix: storing a separate <audio> element within each song that preloads the file from sourceUrl).
Volume slider doesn't change until mouse move after mouse click.

Additional features:
Library that stores all songs.
Replay/shuffle/queue.
